# CSE21_Asgn2

My intention was for this scene to be a moody rainy night influenced by that one scene in My Neighbor Totoro of the two people sitting in the rain. Also influnced by the Noir asthetic to some degree.

Assets:
I want to save myself some trouble
The roads are from the ModularLowPolyStreets pack
The buildings are from the Rune Assets pack
The streetlight is from the StreetLights pack
The skybox is from SkySeries Freebie pack
The phone is from the Free Phone pack
Everything else is created from me or by using primitive shapes such as my planes below the roads, my lights, rain emitter, rain subemitter, my character

Note: In this project I use a Spot Light for the streetlight lights, A Directional Light to simulate moonlight, A Pointlight to brighten up the face, and an emission material on the phone
I use a rain particle emitter and a puddle subemitter for the rain
